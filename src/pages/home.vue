      <p class="lead">I have been using an Android Device for the last few days and am falling in love with the switchs they use in Android. I loved them so much I wanted to port them over to Bootstrap so I could use them in future projects. I did some research and all of the ones I could find used custom colors which prevented them from working with Bootswatch or required you to edit the css files to make them match your theme. I wanted to work around that.</p>
      <p class="lead">Please use the theme picker above to see how this snippet works with bootswatch themes. I hope you enjoy this snippet.</p>
